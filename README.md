# Logistic Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression models using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to classify data from two different datasets: the Iris dataset and the Digits dataset.

## Dataset 1: Iris

**Using the Iris dataset (iris.csv attached or using sklearn):**

### Questions:

1. **Perform an initial analysis of this dataset:**
   - Analyze the dataset structure and summary statistics.
   - Determine the number of samples and features.
   - Check for missing values and data types.
   - How many data samples are there?
   - Are there any missing values? If so, how many?
   - Are all the data numeric, or are there columns with categorical data?
   - Apply logistic regression to evaluate the classification model.

2. **Use boxplots and histograms to characterize the properties of each species:**
   - Plot boxplots for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
   - Plot histograms for the same features.

3. **By only looking at these graphs, is it possible to use one or more of the properties (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) to differentiate between the different species?**

4. **Apply logistic regression to evaluate the classification model.**

5. **Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.**

6. **Plot the confusion matrix using matplotlib or seaborn.**

## Dataset 2: Digits

**Using the Digits dataset. Example of how to import the dataset using sklearn:**
