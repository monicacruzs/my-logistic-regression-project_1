# Logistic Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression models using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to classify data from two different datasets: the Iris dataset and the Digits dataset.

## Dataset 1: Iris

**Using the Iris dataset (iris.csv attached or using sklearn):**

### Questions:

1. **Perform an initial analysis of this dataset:**
   - Analyze the dataset structure and summary statistics.
   - Determine the number of samples and features.
   - Check for missing values and data types.
   - How many data samples are there?
   - Are there any missing values? If so, how many?
   - Are all the data numeric, or are there columns with categorical data?
   - Apply logistic regression to evaluate the classification model.

2. **Use boxplots and histograms to characterize the properties of each species:**
   - Plot boxplots for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
   - Plot histograms for the same features.

3. **By only looking at these graphs, is it possible to use one or more of the properties (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) to differentiate between the different species?**

4. **Apply logistic regression to evaluate the classification model.**

5. **Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.**

6. **Plot the confusion matrix using matplotlib or seaborn.**

## Dataset 2: Digits

**Using the Digits dataset. Example of how to import the dataset using sklearn:**

The digits dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and computer vision tasks. It is included as part of the sklearn.datasets module in scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. 
This dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) represented as 8x8 pixel images. Each image is represented as an array of 64 pixels, and the dataset also includes the corresponding labels indicating the true digit for each image.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
digits = load_digits()
```
